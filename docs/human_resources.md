# Human Resources and AI Delegation

This document outlines the human roles involved in the Moonshot project and highlights activities that can be delegated to AI systems, informed by trends observed in the SWE benchmark.

## Roles

- **Software Architect** – defines system structure and high-level design choices.
- **Project Manager** – coordinates timeline, scope and communication across teams.
- **Cost Estimator** – projects expenses and resource allocations.
- **Security Engineer** – assesses risks and recommends safeguards.
- **DevOps Engineer** – manages deployment pipelines and infrastructure.
- **Performance Engineer** – monitors and optimises system efficiency.
- **Data Engineer** – prepares data pipelines and storage strategies.
- **UX Designer** – crafts user flows and interface guidelines.
- **Data Scientist** – performs exploratory analysis and modelling.

## AI‑Delegable Work

According to SWE benchmark studies, many routine software engineering tasks can be automated. In this project, the following areas are good candidates for AI delegation:

- Boilerplate code generation for new modules and API endpoints.
- Creation of unit tests and basic documentation.
- Data exploration and reporting from structured datasets.
- Refactoring suggestions and static analysis for existing modules.

Critical architectural decisions, security reviews and final approvals should remain with human experts, but repetitive or well‑bounded tasks can be offloaded to the agents or other AI tools.
